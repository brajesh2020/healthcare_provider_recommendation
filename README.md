Background: The practice of excess charge where healthcare providers bill Medicare more than the allowed limit, is pervasive in the United States. Previous research has argued that it is possibly used to set private insurance prices, at times to account for inadequate Medicare reimbursements, ultimately leading to high price variations and causing inequities in healthcare service delivery.

Problem Statement: In the same area or zip code, and for the same service there are sometimes many providers and each one having charges hugely different.

Objective of this Study: The objective of this study is to first give the patients a web interface to select a few specific filters like location , service and based on that to prioritize the top features which help a patient to select the provider with most economical service based on the data at hand which includes average annual charges that the provider charged to medicare for that service.

Methodology used: Weighted Scorecard based on total number of patients serviced , least average cost of service provided.

Result: Our analysis of the top predictive features demonstrates that billing patterns are characteristic of a provider’s overall practice rather than specific medical procedures. Also, our results bear important public health implications in the US as our study reveals socioeconomic and demographic factors to be significant predictors of a provider’s billing patterns.

Conclusion and Future State: Right now there are many providers who charge varying amounts to the medicare for the same service, despite having very little difference in the quality of service provided. Further if there is a provider who is servicing higher number of patients and at lower cost for the same service would be the first preference
